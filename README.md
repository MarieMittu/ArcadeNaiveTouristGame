# Q-rence: Tourist vs. Tourists
Q-rence is a 2D arcade game, kind of endless sorting (*not endless runner!*), developed in Unity. Here I will explain some functionality of the game logic. You can also try this game on a [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/yRu6w645).
## How To Play
In the game there are 3 queues and a tourist walking around waiting for any of the queues to become smaller. Your aim is to lead the appearing tourists to the queues, so that none of them finishes and the walking guy remains angry.
